  "word": "Eager Evaluation",
  "meaning": "In computer programming, eager evaluation or greedy evaluation is the evaluation strategy used by most traditional programming languages. In eager evaluation, an expression is evaluated as soon as it is bound to a variable. The alternative to eager evaluation is lazy evaluation, where expressions are only evaluated when evaluating a dependent expression. Imperative programming languages, where the order of execution is implicitly defined by the structure of the source code, almost always use eager evaluation. One advantage of eager evaluation is that it eliminates the need to track and schedule the evaluation of expressions. It also allows the programmer to dictate the order of execution, making it easier to determine when sub-expressions (including functions) within the expression will be evaluated, as these sub-expressions may have side-effects that will affect the evaluation of other expressions.",

The principle was designed to limit the potential damage of any security breach, whether accidental or malicious. In a personal computing context, you can increase security by using an account without administrative rights. Operating in administrative mode can make your system vulnerable to malicious coding online that would be denied access if you were operating with lower permission levels.

For many modern object oriented languages that use a dot as field identifier, the law can be stated simply as 'use only one dot'. That is, the code a.b.Method() breaks the law where a.Method() does not. As an analogy, when one wants a dog to walk, one does not command the dog's legs to walk directly; instead one commands the dog which then commands its own legs.
